# nordvpn-linux-GUI
This is a small GUI app i created to make my life a bit easier while using the Nord VPN. Since there is no official app from them a tried to implement a simplified GUI version with the basic functions. Please expect that the app is far from perfect and not heavily tested under various circumstances. It has been tested under Ubuntu 20.04 System and a Raspberry Pi 4 (4Gb RAM) and seem to run flawless.

## Resources
The app is written in Python, and specifically the GUI is with tkinter package. So expect that the app is lightweight and could constantly run in background without even noticing.

## Installation
How to run the app:
1. download the project to a local repository
2. open the terminal and make the python file and the script executables by typing:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./path/to/nordvpn-linux-GUI/NordVPN.py && chmod +x ./path/to/nordvpn-linux-GUI/script.sh
    ```
    please change the /path/to/ with your own directory
3. run the NordVPN.py (by clicking the file, or by typing it in terminal) and the app will launch
4. OPTIONAL: you can create a Link/Shortcut of NordVPN.py and open it from your Desktop just like any other app
5. OPTIONAL: if you want to see the app at the system start-up, then you will have to XXXXXXXX)

## Some Screenshots and explanations

## Last words
As I already mentioned, the script is just a tool to help me for my everyday use, and i share it here in case anyone finds it useful. If you experience any trouble, please let me know, there is already a button in the app to navigate you here and file an issue or contact me.
